                    The open space at the Belcher’s in Central and Western district is said to be as big as 3,518 square meters except for the fact that it is encircled by fences that bar non-residents from entering the area. Our reporter attempted to break into the open
                    space but was given a warning that it was a private property by the security guard.

                    <br> <br> Right at the front gate is a sign that reads “Private property. No Trespassing”. Below the sign is a digital card reader that gives residents access to the open space only. It appears that the Belcher’s does not give the
                    public permission to have access to the public space and instead encircle it with security measures.
